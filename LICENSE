LICENSE:

Please understand this software has no warranty. The author(s) of this code
don't accept any responsibility for anything bad that happens because of this code!

I don't know if that's important to say, or if anyone could even sue me for that.
But it can't hurt to say, can it?

# For non-commercial use:

For non-commercial use, feel free to use this software or modify it for any purpose.

But if you do, you must:

    1. Include it with a compatible ('copyleft') license,

    2. Distribute the original source code, plus any modifications you make to
       this code.

    3. Make this clear in the credits of your product and source code, and also
       make sure it's clear how to get the original code, and also make sure it's
       clear how to get the modified code (if you have modifications.)
    
I would also kindly ask you to:

    1. Tell me about your project, because if this code becomes useful or
       interesting in any way, I'd really like to know. Because, to me, this seems
       totally useless.
    
    2. Read GPL-v3 (https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html), so you can,
       like, get the general *vibe* of copyleft.
       
       This isn't a GPL-v3 license, but 

# For commercial use:

For any commercial, profitable, or professional use:

    1. Give me $5 USD.
    
    2. If you make over $200,000 a year, or you are part of a company that makes
       over $500,00 a year, give me $1000 USD, thankyouverymuch.
       
    3. Btw, profitable use includes "reporting on this in a blog or video" and
       having ads on your blog, or having any form of user tracking (such as
       Google Adsense, or whatever) on your personal site.
       
    4. If you're a company that partners with Government immigration enforcement
       (say, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement), and you use this
       code for a product (say, an AI coding partner), then please give me
       $2000 thankyouverymuch.
       
# For people who actually want to use this commercially but don't like this license:

Uh, I reserve the right to change the license for any reason? I'm mostly writing
this repository to make my friends laugh. But if there's a legitimate business
case for this code, I'd really love to hear what that is! It'd be surprising 
to me. And I'd probably be happy to make an exception to the license if you
have something cool or pretty you wanna do with this.
